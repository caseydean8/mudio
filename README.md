Project Title: Moodyoo

Team Members: Shamera Boozer, Casey Carroll, Stevenson Nelson, Cheri Saunders

Project Description:

Our app will ask the user what mood they are in, where the user will select a short list of potential moods. the user will then choose a mood which will reveal a list of related music genres. The user will then choose a genre and the app will return a playlist based on their choice. The user will then be asked to create an account to access a list of local venues and events where their music choice is being played. Will optionally include a night out planner which will show restaurants and/or bars near a selected music venue.

Sketch of Design:

Everything will reload on the same page.
Drop down menus for mood and submenus for genres and venues.
Before user gets list of venues, they must authenticate with user input validation.


APIs:

Spotify
Ticket Master
